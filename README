The easy way:
1. cp vars.sh.example vars.sh
2. edit the SYNC_SERVER and SYNC_HOME variables in vars.sh:
   let point SYNC_HOME into this git-directory
	 point SYNC_SERVER to the best server for you, which is rsync-capable
3. copy the cronjobs to your crontab

The hard way:
There is no such way known yet!
